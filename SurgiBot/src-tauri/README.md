## Tauri's Role:
In a Tauri application, the Rust code (the "Tauri backend") is primarily concerned with providing the application's window, handling native operations, and securing the bridge between your frontend and any system-level features you need access to. It's not directly responsible for web server functionalities like handling HTTP requests or serving web content over the network.

## FastAPI's Role: 
FastAPI would typically run as a separate process, possibly even on a different machine, and your Tauri application would interact with it through HTTP requests, just like any web frontend would interact with its backend. This means you can use FastAPI to manage database interactions, process business logic, handle authentication, and more, while Tauri focuses on the desktop-specific functionalities and user interface.

## Integration: 
Your Tauri application's frontend (the web technology-based UI) can make requests to the FastAPI backend using standard HTTP client libraries (e.g., fetch in JavaScript). This is similar to how you would structure a web application, but in this case, the frontend runs within a Tauri window.
